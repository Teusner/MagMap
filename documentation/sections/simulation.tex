\section*{Simulator}
    A python simulation was realized in order to test the behavior of the system. A class \textit{Tank} has been created to instantiate a vehicle with its sled. Then the script integrates the evolution equation using Euler's method in order to obtain the state of the system $x$ according to the $u$ inputs. The graphical display is done using the software VIBes.
