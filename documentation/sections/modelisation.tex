\section*{Modelisation of the system}
    The system is composed of a vehicle that will drag a sledge that transports a magnetometer. The towing vehicle is a tank type vehicle, and the sled is attached to it with a rope. Assuming that the rope is constantly under tension, we are able to find the equations describing the dynamics of the system. By noting $x$ the state of the system and $u$ its inputs, the dynamics of the system is described by :

    \begin{empheq}[left={\dot{x} = f(x, u) =}\empheqlbrace]{align}
        \dot{x_1} &=\ \dfrac{u_1 + u_2}{2}.cos(x_3) \label{eq:x}\\
        \dot{x_2} &=\ \dfrac{u_1 + u_2}{2}.sin(x_3) \label{eq:y}\\
        \dot{x_3} &=\ u_2 - u_1 \label{eq:theta}\\
        \dot{x_4} &=\ - \dfrac{u_1 + u_2}{2}.sin(x_4) - \dot{x_3} \label{eq:phi}
    \end{empheq}

    Here $x_1$, $x_2$ and $x_3$ are respectively the abscissa, the ordinate and the heading of the trailing robot, $x_4$ is the angle of the sled to the tractor vehicle.
