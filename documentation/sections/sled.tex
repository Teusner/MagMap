\section*{Sled localization}
    By having a box enclosing the trailing robot, and an interval framing the angle $x_4$, we are able to obtain a box containing the sled, knowing the length of the rope.
    
    This box has the shape of a pie sector. \textit{Equation}~\ref{eq:magnetometer} presents the position of the magnetometer as a function of the state of the system $x_1$, $x_2$ and $x_4$. Here all these variables are intervals. By applying a polar contractor to these intervals, we are able to obtain the intervals containing $x_m$ and $y_m$.

    \begin{equation}\label{eq:magnetometer}
        \left\lbrace
            \begin{aligned}
                x_m &= x_1 - L.cos(x_4) \\
                y_m &= x_2 - L.sin(x_4)
            \end{aligned}
        \right.
    \end{equation}
